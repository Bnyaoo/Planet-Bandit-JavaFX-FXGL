- Temporary platforms allow the player to stand on it momentarily; idling on these platforms usually results in the 
  loss of one life.

- Moving platforms allow the player to automatically bridge gaps between terrain. In later stages, idling on a 
  moving platform may result in the loss of one life.

## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:
### Sprint 1 Comments:
- We were unable to get the asteroids in the space invader mini-game working properly, but we did complete many other
things that we did not plan to finish in sprint 1 to make up for it.
- We need to match up our frame sizes to make the space mini-game "part of" the actual game
- We still have a lot of commenting left to do because we spent very long trying to get used to javafx and trying to 
get things working
- We currently have 2 different playable classes because we didn't get the chance to merge them into one yet
