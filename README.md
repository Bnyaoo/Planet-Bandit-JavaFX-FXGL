### Sprint 1 Comments:
- We were unable to get the asteroids in the space invader mini-game working properly, but we did complete many other
  things that we did not plan to finish in sprint 1 to make up for it.
- We need to match up our frame sizes to make the space mini-game "part of" the actual game
- We still have a lot of commenting left to do because we spent very long trying to get used to javafx and trying to
  get things working
- We currently have 2 different playable classes because we didn't get the chance to merge them into one yet

### Sprint 2 Comments:
- We got almost our entire gameplay complete we just need to link the different components of the game to each other
and incorporate a save method
- We need to add in our riddle system
- We decided to change how the space mini-game works because the actual game itself is hard enough
